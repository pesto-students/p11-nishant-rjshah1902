    <!-- Strat Communication of Two New Friends -->
    <p>
        I'm Nobody! Who are you? <br/>
        Are you - Nobody - Too? <br/>
        Then there's a pair of us!<br/>
        Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!
    </p>
    <!-- End Communication of Two New Friends -->


    <!-- Start Another Communication -->
    <p>
        How dreary - to be - Somebody! <br/>
        How public - like a Frog - <br/>
        To tell one's name - the livelong June - <br/>
        To an admiring Bog!
